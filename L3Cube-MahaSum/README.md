# L3Cube-MahaSum
The MahaSUM dataset is a large-scale collection of 25k Marathi news articles, curated to support abstractive summarization in Indic languages. Articles were scraped from various sources and manually verified for quality, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating models like IndicBART. This dataset aims to advance NLP research in Indic languages, especially in high-quality summarization tasks.
